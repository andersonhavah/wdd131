        <p>Lazy loading (also known as asynchronous loading) is a technique used in computer programming, especially web design and web development, to defer initialization of an object until it is needed. It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if properly and appropriately used. This makes it ideal in use cases where network content is accessed and initialization times are to be kept at a minimum, such as in the case of web pages. For example, deferring loading of images on a web page until they are needed for viewing can make the initial display of the web page faster. The opposite of lazy loading is eager loading.A ghost is the object that is to be loaded in a partial state. It may initially only contain the object's identifier, but it loads its own data the first time one of its properties is accessed. For example, consider that a user is about to request content via an online form. At the time of creation, the only information available is that content will be accessed, but the specific action and content is unknown.Overview As the web has evolved, we have come to see huge increases in the number and size of assets sent to users. Between 2011 and 2019, the median resource weight increased from ~100KB to ~400KB for desktop and ~50KB to ~350KB for mobile. While Image size has increased from ~250KB to ~900KB on desktop and ~100KB to ~850KB on mobile. One of the methods we can use to tackle this problem is to shorten the Critical Rendering Path length by lazy loading resources that are not critical for the first render to happen. A practical example would be when you land on the home page of an e-commerce site with a link to a cart page/section, and none of the cart page's resources (such as JavaScript, CSS, and images) are downloaded until you navigate there. What is lazy loading?Lazy loading is the practice of keeping images and other assets on your web page from loading until the user requires them. Resources above the fold will show because they’re supposed to, but images further down won’t load until the user scrolls down to where they’re located on the page.For websites that don't use image lazy loading, what typically happens is that a user will come to your page, and the browser will download every asset and resource before building the page for the user to see.If you’ve ever clicked a link, then had to wait a long time before things properly display, it’s likely because that page contains a lot of resources that take a long time to download and render. This type of delay can cause someone to leave a webpage behind, especially if this occurs with every link on the page they click.But when you implement lazy loading, instead of the browser loading all the resources beforehand, it will instead use a placeholder image for where the image is supposed to go.As the user scrolls, they may even see that placeholder before the browser inserts the image that’s supposed to be there. This method of loading images can increase your page load time, improving the user experience. This is especially true of websites that host a lot of images or iframes. While it’s important to know what lazy loading images means, you also need to understand that lazy loading doesn’t just apply to images. Various assets and resources can benefit from lazy loading, but the lazy loading of images remains the top function. A final potential drawback comes from reduced caching benefits. Caching usually only works when assets are requested. Or, the information in the cache can sit for a long while and become out-of-date or obsolete because of the rarity of its use due to lazy caching. It still helps that you understand some basics, so you can make informed decisions on what to implement or what services to use that can help your site or app perform faster and better for your users. Mailchimp offers a huge number of solutions that can help speed up your website and improve the user experience. Also, you don’t have to know everything at a technical level when you have the tools in place that can help you make your site faster without you needing to delve deep into the coding level.</p>
