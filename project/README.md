### Project: Taste of Togo - A Culinary Guide Website
## Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3 (Responsive Design, Flexbox, CSS Grid, Custom Properties), JavaScript (ES6+) (DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Array Methods, Objects, Template Literals, localStorage API)

# Project Description:

Developed "Taste of Togo," a dynamic and responsive multi-page informational website dedicated to showcasing Togolese cuisine. This project was built from the ground up using core web technologies to demonstrate proficiency in front-end development best practices.

# Key Features & Accomplishments:

`Responsive Design`: Implemented a mobile-first approach ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across various devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops) using pure CSS media queries, Flexbox, and CSS Grid for layout.

`Dynamic Content`: Utilized JavaScript (ES6+) to dynamically generate and update content, including a "Dish of the Week" feature on the homepage and an interactive "Dishes Explorer" page.

`Interactive Filtering`: Developed a client-side filtering system on the "Dishes" page, allowing users to sort and view dishes based on categories (e.g., main ingredient, vegetarian) using JavaScript array methods and DOM manipulation.

`Form Handling & localStorage`: Created an HTML5 form on the "Find Food" page for users to submit their food discoveries. Implemented JavaScript to handle form submission, validate input (basic validation), and store submission data persistently in the browser using the localStorage API.

`Multi-Page Architecture`: Structured the website with clear navigation across multiple HTML pages (Home, Dishes, Find Food, References), ensuring a cohesive user experience.

`Semantic HTML & Accessibility`: Employed semantic HTML5 markup for improved structure and SEO, and incorporated basic accessibility considerations such as ARIA attributes for interactive elements (e.g., mobile menu) and descriptive alt text for images.

`Modular CSS`: Organized CSS into separate stylesheets for base/mobile styles and desktop overrides, utilizing custom properties (CSS variables) for a maintainable and themeable design.

`Vanilla JavaScript`: All dynamic functionalities were implemented using plain JavaScript without relying on external frameworks or libraries, demonstrating a strong understanding of core language features.
