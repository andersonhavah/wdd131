                <p>Togo, a West African nation on the Gulf of Guinea, is known for its palm-lined beaches and hilltop
                    villages. Koutammakou, inhabited by the Batammariba people, is a traditional settlement of
                    fortresslike
                    clay huts dating to the 17th century. Togo has a diverse cuisine influenced by its geographic
                    location
                    and cultural heritage. It is known for its vibrant music scene, with various music styles such as
                    highlife, Afrobeat, and traditional rhythms like Ewe and Kabye. Togo is a multilingual country, with
                    French being the official language.
                    Staple foods in Togolese cuisine include maize, rice, millet, cassava, yam, plantain and beans.
                    Maize is
                    the most commonly consumed food in the Togolese Republic.
